## Image Editor Project

Build a React + Typescript web app that allows users to import photos (either drag-n-drop or otherwise), crop, move, resize, and do something fun with them, e.g. apply a special "brush" or any other effect of your choosing.

The app should somehow implement the concept of a stateful canvas (or "session"). I.e. the entire state of the interaction with a single canvas should be contained such that the user could switch back and forth between canvases.

While **not** required for this execrise, plan for a future where we'd support features such as real-time collaboration, and saving / fetching state from a server.

## Areas of focus:
- Program organization
- Problem modeling
- State management
- Prep for future extensibility (while avoiding premature optimizations)
- Minimal amount of 3rd party deps

## Timeline
Let's aim to wrap this part up by 11/27! :) 

Scope suggestion: plan for net ~2-3 hours of development work
